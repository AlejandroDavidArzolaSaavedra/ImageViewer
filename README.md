## About

Practicing the proxy pattern using the MVP architectural style. This project aims to create a simple image viewer application that employs the proxy pattern for efficient image loading and tracking.

## Project Structure üìÇ

The project follows the standard Maven directory structure. Here's an overview of the main components:

- **`util`**: Contains the `AccessCounter` class, responsible for tracking the number of times an image is accessed.
- **`ui`**: Holds the user interface-related classes, including the `ImageDisplay` interface and its Swing implementation.
- **`persistence`**: Manages image loading and includes the `FileImageLoader` class.
- **`model`**: Defines the core data model, including the `Image` interface, `RealImage`, and `ProxyImage` implementations.
- **`controller`**: Contains the main application logic and the `MainFrame` class responsible for displaying images.

## How to Build üõ†Ô∏è

The project uses Maven as the build tool. To build the project, use the following Maven command:

```bash
mvn clean install
```

This command will compile the source code, run tests, and package the application into a JAR file.

## How to Run ‚ñ∂Ô∏è

To run the application, execute the `Main` class in the `controller` package. This will launch the Image Viewer application, allowing you to navigate through images.

## Classes Overview üìù

### `AccessCounter` (util)

Tracks the number of times an image is accessed.

### `ImageDisplay` (ui)

An interface defining methods for displaying images.

### `SwingImageDisplay` (ui)

An implementation of `ImageDisplay` using Swing for graphical display.

### `FileImageLoader` (persistence)

Loads images from files and provides navigation capabilities.

### `RealImage` (model)

Represents a real image with a name and an input stream.

### `ProxyImage` (model)

A proxy for loading and tracking real images using the `AccessCounter`.

### `Main` (controller)

The main class responsible for launching the Image Viewer application.

### `MainFrame` (controller)

The main frame of the application, displaying images and providing navigation controls.

## Sample Usage üñºÔ∏è

The `Main` class in the `controller` package initializes the Image Viewer with a folder containing images. Use the "<" and ">" buttons to navigate through the images.
